I'm starting a blog in 2020.

This year has been deeply challenging for me. It has been a time filled with lots of change. I have never felt comfortable expressing my views in public, but I'm changing that this year. 


I will be sharing things related to technology. I work as a software engineer and have strong opinions in that area. I would love to hear others thoughts and commentary. Change my mind. Eventually, I'll add a commenting feature to the blog. For now, you can start a conversation with me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nicklmitch).

The blog won't only be technology. I'll be posting artwork I like and make, music I'm interested in, some politics, philosophy, information.

Thanks for reading. Looking forward to connecting via cyberspace!
